Remote desktop protocol
=======================

Windows Server is traditionally managed using its GUI, although remote
PowerShell use through various means is becoming more popular.

GUI management can be done via a directly or KVM-connected video
display, mouse and keyboard. As with linux instances, AWS doesn’t
provide emulated KVM access. Only a screenshot picture of the instance
can be taken.

When learning Linux, we used SSH to connect. Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) is the standard way to manage remote windows servers (and clients)
and is built into Microsoft Windows. Key things to note:

-   RDP runs over TCP on port 3389.

-   RDP must be enabled on the Windows control panel of the server for
    it to work. AMIs for Windows on AWS have RDP enabled already.

-   RDP sessions are not as “independent” of each other as SSH sessions
    are:

    -   Generally Windows Server supports a maximum of two concurrent
        separate user logins over a combination of RDP (and the local
        console, which isn’t present on AWS).

    -   Windows Clients (e.g. XP, 7, 8, 10) normally support only one
        login at a time (over all methods). If the same user logs in,
        the existing session should be picked-up/transferred.

-   RDP allows a number of different enhancements to be selected when
    connecting:

    -   The resolution of the remote session can be set when connecting.

    -   Current RDP versions allow multi-monitor support.

    -   File sharing can be enabled for the session so that necessary
        files can be easily transferred between the client and
        RDP server.

    -   Ports can also be attached.

    -   Audio and printer output can be redirected back to the client.

-   RDP does not support user managed keys like SSH, but can support
    single sign-on through Active Directory if both the client and
    server share the same domain.

Terminal Services
-----------------

Terminal Services is a licensing extension to remote desktop to enable a
number of different concurrent remote sessions to be open. It is
sometimes used to allow users to “pick up” their desktop at different
computers, often thin clients.

Alternatives
------------

VNC

:   is often used in Windows to present the console remotely, in either
    view-only or view & control mode. VNC is cross platform and has
    clients for almost every operating system, but is limited somewhat
    by its weak authentication.

Proprietary solutions

:   like TeamViewer and GoToMyPC require additional client software, can
    be easier to setup for non-technical users and often can traverse
    NAT routers automatically.

Command-line access
-------------------

-   **PowerShell remoting** gives access to the PowerShell interface of
    a remote Windows computer. It can be used on a basic level like SSH,
    but underneath is quite different, with different strengths
    and weaknesses.

-   **SSH** access to Windows is possible using OpenSSH, offering access
    to `cmd.exe` or `PowerShell` from remote computers.

VPC setup
=========

VPC for this week in the file `ec2_windows_vpc_setup.ps1`

This is largely the same as the linux Lab except that:

-   Checks for the existence of your `LAB_KEY` before continuing.

-   Creates the security group `LAB_SG`

-   Adds a rule to `LAB_SG` to permit RDP (Port 3389) access.

Output should be similar to:

    KeyPair: key-09a3afe83db8e8381
    VPC: vpc-0209bd43322117a41
    Subnet: subnet-05fa961d022b72730
    IGW: igw-0d070969dfd43c2cf
    Route Table: rtb-0b56038dfec860e3d
    {
        "Return": true
    }
    Security Group: sg-0326166674b0b68f0
    Modified security group to permit RDP access

Lookup Image Ids automatically (move for 2021)
==============================================

Image IDs are region and account-dependent. They also get updated as
Amazon update the images.

``` {.powershell}
# print out list of Windows AMIs
ami ssm get-parameters-by-path -path /aws/service/ami-windows-latest --query "Parameters[].Name" 
```

The “standard” windows image we will use is
`Windows_Server-2019-English-Full-Base`.

Provisioning a Windows Instance
===============================

These steps assume you are familiar with provisioning a linux instance
from the previous week’s lab.

Launching the instance
----------------------

To start a Windows instances, we mainly need the same set of
information:

-   The AMI of the Windows image. We will use *Microsoft Windows Server
    2019 Base*. Check the AMI as it appears on your own account.

-   The Subnet ID to launch the instance into

-   The instance type (from `aws ec2 describe-instance-types`)

-   Security Group ID

The Key Pair is still needed, but it serves a different function in
Windows instances compared to Linux instances. We use exactly the same
launch command as for Linux instance last week.

We can use Systems Manager to launch an instance using the following
syntax. Instead of giving an AMI directly we use `resolve:ssm:` to tell
AWS to look this value up in SSM.

This week though we are are going to capture the command output into a
variable \$Output to work with it in Powershell.

``` {.powershell}
# Capture the command output
$Output = (aws ec2 run-instances `
--subnet-id subnet-05fa961d022b72730 `
--instance-type t2.micro `
--image-id resolve:ssm:/aws/service/ami-windows-latest/Windows_Server-2019-English-Full-Base `
--key-name LAB_KEY `
--security-group-ids sg-0326166674b0b68f0 `
)

# Print the JSON to screen (as if we didn't capture)
$Output

# Do the conversion
$InstanceInfo=$Output | ConvertFrom-Json

# Extract the instance ID
$InstanceId = $InstanceInfo.Instances[0].InstanceId
```

Connecting over RDP
===================

To connect to our Windows instance over RDP we need to know the Public
IP and the password for the administrator account.

Determining the public IP
-------------------------

We can request the full information (including the public IP). Here we
use PowerShell to extract the public IP.

``` {.powershell}
# Print the JSON
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-id $InstanceId

# Get the instance information for the new instance as PS object
$Instance=(aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-id $InstanceId | ConvertFrom-Json).Reservations.Instances[0]

# Extract the public IP
$PublicIp = $Instance.NetworkInterfaces[0].Association[0].PublicIp
```

Other information can be found in a similar way.

Getting password data
---------------------

To get the password data for a given instance ID:

    aws ec2 get-password-data --instance-id i-01248802a6d0dd331

which will return something like

    {
        "InstanceId": "i-01248802a6d0dd331",
        "PasswordData": "\r\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\r\n",
        "Timestamp": "2020-10-27T22:07:39.000Z"
    }

If the password is blank, it means that the post-launch setup hasn’t yet
completed. Just pause here and try it again in a couple of minutes. When
the PasswordData field is non-empty you can continue.

The PasswordData is the password encrypted with your public key. You can
pass an additional parameter to `get-password-data` to decrypt this
using your private key. Obviously replace the private key path with your
own!

    aws ec2 get-password-data --instance-id i-01248802a6d0dd331 --priv-launch-key C:\Users\peadar\.ssh\id_rsa

If successful, this will produce the output:

    {
        "InstanceId": "i-01248802a6d0dd331",
        "PasswordData": "5G.XW752i?VoJm;Y8Ch-rEI5e?i8fFC5",
        "Timestamp": "2020-10-27T22:07:39.000Z"
    }

The decrypted password shown matches the Windows local Administrator
account.

Connecting with the graphical client
------------------------------------

Look for Remote Desktop Connnection in the start menu. Use the IP
address, username Administrator, and the password and hit Connect.

You should be at a standard Windows desktop running on the remote
machine. At this point you can administer the machine any way you want,
including setting up a new admin user account and/or changing the
password.

Starting RDP client from PowerShell
-----------------------------------

The RDP client is a program called `mstsc.exe`. To show its options type

    mstsc /?

We will connect by typing:

    mstsc.exe /v:$PublicIp 

Put in Administrator and the password. (It’s not simple to launch RDP
directly with the password pre-filled.)

SSH server on Windows
=====================

Remote Desktop is just one way to access a Windows server for
management. Windows now supports SSH access to the command-prompt (and
to PowerShell).

Checking if OpenSSH is installed
--------------------------------

On your AWS Windows Server open PowerShell and type

``` {.powershell}
Get-WindowsCapability -Online -Name Open*
```

You will see something like:

    Name         : OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
    State        : Installed
    DisplayName  : OpenSSH Client
    Description  : OpenSSH-based secure shell (SSH) client, for secure key management and access to remote machines.
    DownloadSize : 1323493
    InstallSize  : 5301402

    Name         : OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
    State        : NotPresent
    DisplayName  : OpenSSH Server
    Description  : OpenSSH-based secure shell (SSH) server, for secure key management and access from remote machines.
    DownloadSize : 1297677
    InstallSize  : 4946932

To install the OpenSSH server we type

``` {.powershell}
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
```

If it succeeded you’ll see

    Path          :
    Online        : True
    RestartNeeded : False

Re-run the `Get-WindowsCapability` command to confirm it’s now
installed.

Server startup
--------------

SSH is provided by a server process called `sshd`.

First we confirm the service exists:

``` {.powershell}
Get-Service sshd
```

From the output we note that it is installed but isn’t currently
running:

    Status   Name               DisplayName
    ------   ----               -----------
    Running  sshd               OpenSSH SSH Server

This server needs to be started and to be configured to start
automatically on reboot:

``` {.powershell}
# start immediately
Start-Service sshd

# Set to start automatically on boot
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType automatic
```

Testing SSH server from same EC2 instance
-----------------------------------------

Now we can test it by connecting from the EC2 instance itself.

    ssh Administrator@localhost

and entering the admin password. We’re actually at the older command.com
prompt, but this can be changed to Powershell using system
configuration.

Connecting from our computer to EC2 SSH server
----------------------------------------------

The main reason to use SSH would be to connect from our own local
computer to the EC2 instance. SSH uses TCP port 22, which isn’t
currently permitted by the security group. There are two possibilities:
create a second security group and assign it to the machine, or modify
the existing group.

We will add a new rule to additionally permit SSH (as well as RDP) in:

    aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-08e934eb80d1d8f70 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0 --protocol tcp --port 22

Then

On our local computer we type:

    ssh Administrator@$PublicIp

and put in the machine’s password. (Notice here that although AWS did
setup the private keys for us, that it doesn’t inject the private key
into the EC2 instance for us as with Linux.)

You have successfully connected over SSH if you see output similar to
the following:

    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1518]
    (c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

    administrator@EC2AMAZ-3DE14BE C:\Users\Administrator>

This is actually the older command.com shell, rather than PowerShell. We
can run powershell from here by just typing:

    powershell

Typing `exit` will get us back out of Powershell, and `exit` again will
close the SSH session.

Configuring SSH
---------------

If you intend to use SSH to work with Windows regularly you should take
the time to configure it properly. Here are a few tips:

-   There are a number of ways to reconfigure SSHd to launch PowerShell
    instead, with various drawbacks.

-   Use the local user/group management to limit who is allowed to login
    over SSH.

-   Use public/private keys and disable password authentication. You
    will have to consult the OpenSSH docs for Windows as the
    configuration is slightly different to Linux.

-   If using SSH keys, learn about agent forwarding.
